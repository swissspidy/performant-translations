Making internationalization/localization in WordPress faster than ever before.

== Description ==

=== Disclaimer about WordPress 6.5 ===

**Attention:** most functionality of this plugin has been merged into WordPress 6.5! You might not need it anymore.

_However_, this plugin is still relevant for cases where language packs are not downloaded from WordPress.org but somewhere else, for example if you are developing your own plugins or using commercial plugins.

The Performant Translations plugin converts the translation files of those plugins to the new file format introduced in WordPress 6.5, to really optimize them for speed.

=== What this plugin does ===

This project uses a new approach to handle translation files in WordPress, making localization blazing fast.

An [in-depth i18n performance analysis](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/24/i18n-performance-analysis/) showed that localized WordPress sites load significantly slower than a site without translations.

With this plugin's new approach to localization, this overhead is massively reduced, making your site fast again. It does so by converting `.mo` translation files to `.php` files.

If your site is using a language other than English (US), you should see immediate speed improvements simply by activating this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes this plugin so fast? =

By converting `.mo` files to `.php` files, the translations can be parsed much faster.
Plus, `.php` files can be stored in the so-called [OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php), which provides an additional speed boost.

= Can I use this plugin on my production site? =

While the plugin is mostly considered to be a beta testing plugin, it has been tested and established to a degree where it should be okay to use in production.
Still, as with every plugin, you are doing so at your own risk.

= Has this plugin been tested with other multilingual plugins? =

Yes. This plugin has been tested with common multilingual plugins, such as WPML, Weglot, TranslatePress, MultilingualPress, and Polylang.
If you still encounter issues, please let us know.

= Do I need to do anything special to enable this plugin? =

No. Once the plugin is activated, it just works, and you should see speed improvements right away. If you run into issues, please open a new support topic.

= Can I safely remove this plugin after installation? =

Yes. Once you deactivate and uninstall the plugin, all `.php` files generated by it will be removed from the server.

= How can I contribute to the plugin? =
