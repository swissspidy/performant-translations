Making internationalization/localization in WordPress faster than ever before.

== Description ==

This project uses a new approach to handle translation files in WordPress, making localization blazing fast.

An [in-depth i18n performance analysis](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/07/24/i18n-performance-analysis/) showed that localized WordPress sites load significantly slower than a site without translations.

With this plugin's new approach to localization, this overhead is massively reduced, making your site fast again.

If your site is using a language other than English (US), you should see immediate speed improvements simply by activating this plugin.

=== WordPress 6.5 and newer ===

**Important:** this new functionality has been merged into WordPress 6.5! However, this plugin is still useful!

On WordPress 6.5+, this plugin automatically converts existing `.mo` files to `.php` and afterwards only loads the translations from the `.php` file.
This is useful for cases where language packs are not downloaded from WordPress.org but somewhere else.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes this plugin so fast? =

By converting `.mo` files to `.php` files, the translations can be parsed much faster.
Plus, `.php` files can be stored in the so-called [OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php), which provides an additional speed boost.

= Can I use this plugin on my production site? =

While the plugin is mostly considered to be a beta testing plugin, it has been tested and established to a degree where it should be okay to use in production.
Still, as with every plugin, you are doing so at your own risk.

= Has this plugin been tested with other multilingual plugins? =

Yes. This plugin has been tested with common multilingual plugins, such as WPML, Weglot, TranslatePress, MultilingualPress, and Polylang.
If you still encounter issues, please let us know.

= Do I need to do anything special to enable this plugin? =

No. Once the plugin is activated, it just works, and you should see speed improvements right away. If you run into issues, please open a new support topic.

= Can I safely remove this plugin after installation? =

Yes. Once you deactivate and uninstall the plugin, all `.php` files generated by it will be removed from the server.

= How can I contribute to the plugin? =
